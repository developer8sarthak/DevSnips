/*
Snippet Name: Parent Selector with :has()
Use Case: To style a parent or ancestor element based on its children or their state. This is often called a "parent selector."
Description: The :has() pseudo-class is a powerful tool for relational styling. The first example styles a button only if it contains a child with the .icon class. The second example styles a container if it has more than a certain number of children.
*/

/* Example 1: Style a button that contains an icon */
button:has(.icon) {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5em;
}

/* Example 2: Change container style if it has at least 5 children */
.container:has(> :nth-child(5)) {
  background: lightyellow;
  border: 1px solid gold;
}
