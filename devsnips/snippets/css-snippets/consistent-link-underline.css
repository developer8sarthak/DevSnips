/*
Snippet Name: Consistent Link Underline
Use Case: To create a more readable and aesthetically pleasing text underline that does not clash with letter descenders (e.g., g, p, y).
Description: This snippet uses `text-decoration-skip-ink: none` to force the underline to be continuous, and then uses `text-underline-offset` to move the underline down slightly, creating space for the descenders.

.consistent-underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-skip-ink: none; /* Ensures the line is solid */
  text-underline-offset: 4px; /* Adjust this value as needed */
  text-decoration-thickness: 1px; /* Optional: control thickness */
}
