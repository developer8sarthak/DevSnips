/*
Snippet Name: Full-Screen Overlay
Use Case: To create an overlay that covers the entire viewport, often used as a background for modal dialogs, pop-ups, or full-screen loading indicators.
Description: This class uses `position: fixed` and sets all four positional properties (top, left, right, bottom) to 0 to make the element stretch to cover the entire screen. A high `z-index` ensures it appears above other content.
