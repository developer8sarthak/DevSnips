/*
Snippet Name: Springy Easing with linear()
Use Case: To create more natural, complex animation easing effects like springs or bounces directly in CSS without relying on JavaScript or predefined keywords like 'ease-in-out'.
Description: The `linear()` easing function allows you to define a custom animation progress curve by specifying a series of points. This example shows the signature for a springy effect.
Cautions: This is a very new feature. Check browser support before using. The syntax can be verbose.
