/*
Snippet Name: Auto-Resizing Textarea
Use Case: To create a <textarea> element that automatically grows in height to fit its content as the user types, avoiding a scrollbar.
Description: This snippet provides the basic CSS for an auto-resizing textarea. It removes the default scrollbar and resize handle.
Cautions: This CSS-only part is not fully functional on its own. It requires a small amount of JavaScript to listen to the `input` event and adjust the `height` of the textarea to match its `scrollHeight`.
