Snippet Name: Combined Inset and Outer Box-Shadow
Use Case: To create a more complex and layered visual effect on elements like buttons or cards by combining both an outer shadow and an inner (inset) shadow.
Description: This snippet applies two comma-separated `box-shadow` values to an element: a standard outer shadow for a lifting effect and an inset shadow for an inner embossed or pressed effect.
