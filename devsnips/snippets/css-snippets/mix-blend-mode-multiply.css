Snippet Name: Mix Blend Mode
Use Case: To control how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's background. It's great for creating effects like image overlays or artistic text.
Description: This snippet demonstrates the `mix-blend-mode` property. The `multiply` value will darken the background by blending the element's content (e.g., text or an image) with its background color.

  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
