/*
Snippet Name: color-contrast() Function (CSS Color Level 5)
Use Case: To automatically select the most readable color (e.g., black or white) from a list to be placed over a given background color, ensuring accessible text contrast.
Description: The `color-contrast()` function takes a background color and compares it against a list of other colors, picking the one with the highest contrast ratio. This is extremely useful for accessible, theme-able components.
Cautions: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT YET WIDELY SUPPORTED. This is a forward-looking example based on the CSS Color Level 5 specification. Check for browser support before using in production.

  /* The browser will pick either 'white' or 'black' depending on which has better contrast against the button's background color. */
