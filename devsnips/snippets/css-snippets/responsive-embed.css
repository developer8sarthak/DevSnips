/*
Snippet Name: Responsive Media Embed
Use Case: To make embedded content like videos (from YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) or iframes responsive, maintaining their aspect ratio as the viewport changes.
Description: This snippet creates a container that maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio using the classic `padding-top` trick. The embedded `iframe` or `video` is then positioned absolutely to fill this container.
