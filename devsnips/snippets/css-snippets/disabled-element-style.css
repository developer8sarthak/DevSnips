/*
Snippet Name: Disabled Element Style
Use Case: To visually indicate that an interactive element (like a button or link) is currently disabled and to prevent mouse interactions.
Description: This class reduces the element's opacity to make it look "grayed out" and sets `pointer-events: none` to prevent clicks, hovers, and other mouse events.

.disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  pointer-events: none;
  cursor: not-allowed; /* Optional: show a 'not-allowed' cursor */
}
