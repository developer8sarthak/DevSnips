/*
Snippet Name: Visually Hidden
Use Case: To hide an element visually from the screen but keep it accessible to screen readers. This is crucial for accessibility, for example, with "skip to content" links or descriptive text for icons.
Description: This class uses a combination of properties to hide an element in a way that it is not visible on the screen but is still part of the document's accessibility tree.
