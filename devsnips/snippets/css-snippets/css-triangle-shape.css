Snippet Name: CSS-only Triangle
Use Case: To create a triangle shape using CSS, which can be used for tooltips, dropdown arrows, or other decorative elements without needing an image or SVG.
Description: This snippet creates a triangle by manipulating the borders of a zero-width, zero-height element. The color of one border is set, while the others are made transparent, forming a triangle shape.
