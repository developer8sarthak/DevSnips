/*
Snippet Name: Smooth Scroll Behavior
Use Case: To enable smooth, animated scrolling when a user clicks on an in-page anchor link (e.g., <a href="#section2">), instead of an instant jump.
Description: This snippet applies the `scroll-behavior: smooth` property to the root element. This single line of CSS tells the browser to handle the scrolling animation natively.
