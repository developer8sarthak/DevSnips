/*
Snippet Name: Global Box-Sizing Reset
Use Case: To standardize the CSS box model across all elements, making layouts more intuitive and preventing issues with padding and borders affecting element dimensions.
Description: This snippet sets `box-sizing: border-box` on all elements and their pseudo-elements. This ensures that the `width` and `height` properties include content, padding, and borders, not just the content.
