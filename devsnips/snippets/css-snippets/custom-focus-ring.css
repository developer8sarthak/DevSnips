/*
Snippet Name: Custom Focus Ring (:focus-visible)
Use Case: To provide clear, accessible focus indicators for keyboard users while hiding the default outline for mouse users, improving aesthetics without harming accessibility.
Description: This snippet removes the default outline on `:focus` but adds a custom one back for `:focus-visible`, which is intelligently applied by browsers primarily for keyboard navigation.
*/
/* Reset default outline for all elements on focus */
:focus {
  outline: none;
}
/* Apply a custom outline only when an element is focused via keyboard */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px dotted #3498db;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
