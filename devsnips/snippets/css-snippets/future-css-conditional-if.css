/*
Snippet Name: Future CSS Conditional Logic (Hypothetical)
Use Case: To conditionally apply CSS values based on custom property values or other states directly within a property, without needing separate rulesets.
Description: This snippet describes a hypothetical future CSS feature for conditional logic (e.g., an `if()` function or `@when` rule). This would allow a developer to switch between values based on a condition, making dynamic styling more concise. For example, `color: if(var(--theme) = dark, white, black);`.
Cautions: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT AND IS NOT SUPPORTED IN ANY BROWSER. It is based on early specification drafts and may change or never be implemented. Do not use in production.
