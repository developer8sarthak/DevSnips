/*
Snippet Name: Fade-in on Scroll Animation
Use Case: To animate elements into view as the user scrolls down the page, adding a dynamic and engaging feel to the content.
Description: This snippet defines the styles for a fade-in animation. An element starts as transparent and slightly moved down. When it becomes "visible," it fades in and moves up.
Cautions: This is a CSS-only implementation of the *styles*. To make it functional, you must use JavaScript (typically with the Intersection Observer API) to add the `.visible` class to the element when it enters the viewport.
