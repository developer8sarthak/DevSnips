/*
Snippet Name: View Transitions API (Cross-fade)
Use Case: To create smooth, animated transitions between page states or full page navigations, such as a cross-fade effect, without complex JavaScript animations.
Description: This snippet enables the View Transitions API for navigation. By default, it creates a cross-fade effect. You can assign specific elements a `view-transition-name` to animate them individually between states.
Cautions: This is a very new browser feature. Check for wider support and be aware of the spec changing before using in production.
