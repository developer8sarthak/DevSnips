/*
Snippet Name: Native CSS Nesting
Use Case: To write more organized, readable, and maintainable CSS for complex components by nesting child selectors and pseudo-classes within the parent rule, similar to Sass/SCSS.
Description: This snippet demonstrates native CSS nesting. The `&` symbol is used to refer to the parent selector (`.card`). You can nest child elements (`&__title`) and pseudo-states (`&:hover`) directly inside the parent rule.
Cautions: This is a new feature. Check for browser support before using.
