/*
Snippet Name: Truncate Text with Ellipsis
Use Case: For trimming single-line text that is too long to fit in its container, appending an ellipsis (...) to indicate that the text has been shortened.
Description: This utility class prevents text from wrapping to a new line and truncates it with an ellipsis if it overflows the container's width.
