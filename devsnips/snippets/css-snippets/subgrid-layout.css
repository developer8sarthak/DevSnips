/*
Snippet Name: Subgrid
Use Case: To align items in a nested grid with the tracks of its parent grid, creating more consistent and complex layouts without manual calculations.
Description: This snippet shows a parent grid with three columns. The child grid, which is an item within the parent, uses `grid-template-columns: subgrid` to adopt the parent's column tracks, ensuring its items align perfectly.

.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.child-grid {
  /* This element is a grid item of .parent-grid */
  grid-column: span 3; /* Make it span all parent columns */

  /* Now, turn it into a grid container and use subgrid */
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  gap: 0.5rem; /* Can have its own gap */
