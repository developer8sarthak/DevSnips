/*
Snippet Name: Scroll Snap Container
Use Case: To create scrollable containers where items "snap" into a specific alignment as the user scrolls. Ideal for image carousels, full-page sections, or user onboarding flows.
Description: This snippet sets up a scroll snap container. The `scroll-snap-type` property defines the axis and strictness of the snap. The `scroll-snap-align` property on the child items determines where they should align within the viewport.
